# diurnal_growthvariations

Simulation approch to better understand the growth and turnover of the microbial population within the proximal large intestine, depending on diurnal variations in nutrient supply and growth. 

This repoistory contains the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation files we used in our work "Diurnal  variations in nutrient supply and host-controlled luminal flow determine microbial growth dynamics and turnover along the human large intestine". 

We further provide Python code which we used to analyze simulation results and prepare the figures and plots included in our manuscript.
